## Project Goals
In summary this repo will use jQuery, BootStrap and date.js to create a "Work Day Scheduler" calendar application. 
==============================================================================================================================   
Github:  
    Create Repo (github, repositories => New)  
    Clone to local machine (Copy https, then git clone paste).  
    Create a nice long READ.md file!!  (Modify prior projects.)  
    Copy directories and sample files from prior project (or create from scratch). 
        -- Copied over starter code. Copied one file at a time via command line. Worked well.
        -- Alternate: Go to Demo (root) folder, download zip, moving to local repo, unzip - likely fastest method.     
        -- Could not find a better way to copy over all files.    
    ... create HTML, CSS and javascript, etc. ...  
    Commit and push files back to gitHub  
    Deploy code (Settings ... CA on left, GitHub Pages->main)  
        - Deployed code name always msheliga1/github.io/RepoName !!
    Make Sure it Works  
    Insert Screenshot of deployment into readme file.  
  
HTML, CSS and Javascript - JQuery, Bootstrap, Date.js, etc. 
    View the Acceptance Criteria. 
    Create/Modify HTML, CSS and Javascript/JQuery. 

    Acceptance Criteria

    I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
    WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    WHEN I scroll down, THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
    WHEN I view the time blocks for that dayTHEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
    WHEN I click into a time block, THEN I can enter an event
    WHEN I click the save button for that time block, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
    WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist
